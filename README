Based on Demystifying the TLC5940 - Chapter 9 by Matt Pandina
Modified to use shift register for row multiplexing by J.B. Langston


This is my fork of the projects mentioned above.   I plan to expand the main.c file to have a serial interface like the example
in the arduino tlc5940 library.  I'm also using sparkfun's awesome RGB LED Button Pads, so I'm going to integrate button row scans
with the led matrix. Last but not least, I hope to implement much of the functionalities of the Adafruit GFX library on top of this

Note: JB Langston's project was setup to use 1 TLC5940, this one is setup to use 3 - one for each color.   I'm also using a 74HC164 
to shift out row data which is then handed off to TLC59213 (clocked with the same SCLK as the 164)
